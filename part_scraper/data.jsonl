Based on the description that you have provided, we would recommend checking the float switch, part number PS11750031. The dishwasher float switch is actuated by rising water, which will then interrupt power to the inlet valve to prevent the appliance from overfilling. However, the contacts in the switch can short out and not interrupt the voltage to the inlet valve as needed. If the float switch is not faulty, you may need to check the center wash arm assembly, part number PS11755664, and the upper wash arm assembly, part number PS11752935. If the wash arm is cracked, it can allow a jet of water to spray toward the door seal, causing a leak. Remove the wash arm and inspect it for cracks. If the wash arm is cracked, you may need to replace it. If there is no issue with the wash arm assemblies, you may need to check the water inlet valve, part number PS11752927. The water inlet valve opens to allow water to enter the dishwasher. If the water inlet valve is stuck open, the dishwasher will continue to fill with water until it leaks or overflows. If the water inlet valve is not faulty, then you may need to check the drain pump, part number PS11738151. We hope this helps!"}

To replace the power cord make sure the old power cord is unplugged and the water supply is turned off. Use a quarter inch socket or nut driver to unthread the screws which are securing the water supply line retainer to the rear panel and detach the water supply line from the inlet valve. Next, unthread the remaining screws which are securing the rear access panel. Set the panel aside to make it easier to access the power cord grounding wire mounting screw. You can move the compressor and inverter board out of the way. Pull off the three retaining pins and remove the washers. Now, carefully lift up the compressor and inverter board and move them to the right. Unthread the screws securing the power cord retaining clip as well as the screw securing the grounding wire. You can now disconnect the wire connector to fully remove the old power cord. Prepare the new power cord for installation by transferring the retaining clip from the old cord to the new one. Now connect the wire connector and secure the grounding wire to the refrigerator base with the screw. Thread and tighten the screw to secure the power cord retaining clip. Now reposition the compressor and inverter board. With the washers in place, secure the compressor with the three retaining pins. Reposition the rear access panel and secure it with the screws. Reattach the water supply line to the inlet valve, and secure the line to the rear panel with the retainer. Turn the water supply back on. We hope this information helps!"}

There are two parts that you should check for this issue. The first part to test would be your water inlet valve. The valve has two solenoids that control either the dispenser or the ice maker. The valve can be tested with a multi meter and should be reading between 500 - 1500 ohms of resistance. If that part is testing correctly then you should look into your ice maker being the issue. Good luck with your repair."}

Unplug the dishwasher and shut off your water supply before installation. Use a 5/8\" wrench to unthread the water supply line fitting from the shutoff valve. Water may spill out. Use a Phillips screwdriver to remove the screws at the lower access panel. Remove the screws securing the inner access panel. Lift up the panel to detach it. Remove the nuts and bolts securing the grounding wire to remove the panel. Remove the screws securing the junction box cover and pull it off. Take note of the wire locations and remove the wire nuts. Unthread the wire strain relief nut and detach the nut from the junction box. Disconnect the drain hose from the sink drain or garbage disposer and feed it through the cabinet. Open the dishwasher's door and remove the mounting bracket screws. You may need to adjust the legs to lower the appliance, then  carefully pull the dishwasher out of the cabinet. Open the door and slide out the lower rack. Use pliers to rotate the water panel grille counterclockwise and then remove it. Lift the insulation and remove the pressure hose from the water panel retaining clip. Break the clamp securing the water valve hose to the water panel and remove the hose. Release the spring clamp to remove the hose from the drain pump. Detach the two drain hose retaining clips and remove the clips from your hose. Pull the old drain hose free. Unthread the grille from the water panel and attach the drain hose to the new panel. Reverse this procedure to install the part.\n\nI hope this helps."}

The best way to do this is to remove the thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature.

With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms.

You will need to check the run capacitor, the evaporator fan motor, the defrost thermostat, the start device, the condenser fan motor kit and the temperature control thermostat.  I hope this helps.

Took apart and actuator is clicking against the electronic part like its supposed to.  How can i be sure the issue is the inlet valve before i spend $50 on it?"], "Answer": "Hi Brian,\nThank you for your question.  To verify if the water inlet valve is causing the issue, you will need to test it with a multimeter.  Before you begin to test your icemaker's water inlet valve, make sure you disconnect the appliance's power supply. The easiest way to do this is to unplug the unit from the wall. Alternatively, you could trip the appropriate switch in the circuit breaker panel, or you could remove the appropriate fuse from your home's fuse box.  Consult with an appliance repair technician if you do not feel you have the skill or the ability to successfully complete this test.  Locate your icemaker's water inlet valve, it is typically located behind a refrigerator. Gently pull your refrigerator away from the wall. You may want to place scraps of carpet, of some other soft material below the fridge to prevent damage to the floor. Turn of the water valve's water supply by closing the shut-off valve in the waterline leading to the water valve. Remove the lower access panel on the back of the refrigerator using a screwdriver or a nut driver.  Place a container under the valve to catch any water that may spill from the water valve and its fill tube. Remove the water valve's fill tubing. Loosen the flare nut on the brass fitting that is found on the inlet side of the water valve. You can use a wrench to loosen the flare nut.  Your water inlet valve is held in place on your refrigerator by means of a metal bracket. Use a screwdriver or a nutdriver to remove the screw that holds the water valve's bracket to the refrigerator cabinet. Gently pull the water valve out of the cabinet, and remove the tube from the outlet port.  There are two wires connecting to the terminals of your water inlet valve. If yours is a double solenoid water valve, it will have four wires. Be sure to label each wire so that you know where to reconnect them later. Firmly grasp the metal connector of the wires in order to remove the wires. You may need to use a pair of needle-nosed pliers. Do not pull on the wires themselves.\nSet your multitester to the R X 1 ohms setting to test for continuity. Place each of the multitester's leads on a terminal. Your multitester should display a reading between 200 and 500 ohms. Closely examine your water inlet valve. The exact ohm resistance rating you should test for may be marked on the valve.  If the test you conduct with your icemaker water inlet valve does not produce these results, then you should replace the component.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"}

Thank you."], "Answer": "Hi Philip, thank you for your question. It could if that is what the issue is. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."}

The part number listed under your model number for the drain tube kit is PS8691807.  If the there is ice buildup at the drain tube, there is likely debris in it preventing water from draining.  The water will pool on the floor and then freeze. The drain tube will need to be either cleaned out or if it is damaged, it will need to be replaced.

There are two parts that you should check for this issue. The first part to test would be your water inlet valve. The valve has two solenoids that control either the dispenser or the ice maker.

Also, check the coils on back of the refrigerator to make sure they are clean.  As refrigerant passes through the coils, heat is given off as the refrigerant cools.  If the coils are dirty, the temperature in the refrigerator will fluctuate.  Check the area around the compressor.  If this area is also dirty, the refrigerator may not operate normally.  Find out where the smell is coming from and check the parts in that area to see which is causing the issue.  If you have any questions, please let us know.  We are open 7 days a week.

Some water might drip, so keep a cloth handy. To install the new filter, place it into the cartridge holder and turn to the right until it will no longer turn. If you have a top-freezer model it should be situated vertically, and if it is a bottom-freezer model, it should be placed horizontally. Be careful not to over-tighten. If your model has a replacement indicator light, reset it by pushing and holding it down for three seconds.

There are a number of parts that can cause leaking inside of your appliance. The first part in the list is your water inlet valve, water lines, grommet and tube assembly (which is the part that fills water to your ice maker) if you have the older version and the tube does not have an opening at the top, it could be that your current fill tube is icing up at times and wont let water through when it is being called up. Causing a back leak. I would suggest looking at those parts first.

The best way to do this is to remove the thermistor from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor.

With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms.

The most common reason you would need to change this part is if you have never updated your model and it is no longer filtering your water. This also may lead to your refrigerator not dispensing water or ice properly. Manufacturers recommend you change your filter every six months to ensure it properly filters impurities. Depending on the model, a red light might also indicate that the filter is due for a replacement. Note: As per the manufacturer, this is an updated water filter. If you have never installed the updated part or your old model was made by Culligan, you may need the adapter to install the filter. See related parts. This filter is located inside the refrigerators upper right corner. It is common for water to drip from the dispenser when being changed so place a cloth underneath before you begin this repair. To remove the filter, turn it to the left until it releases without pulling down. Fill the new filter with tap water to prepare it. Position the new filter into the holder taking note of the arrows. The arrow on the front should be facing out. Gently push up on the filter and turn it to the right to secure it. Do not over-tighten. To release air in the system run 1-1/2 gallons of water through it. If your model has a reset button, press and hold this for a few seconds to reset it."}

This will affect the performance of the compressor. This evaporator fan motor is located in the back of the freezer section of your refrigerator, behind the auger motor assembly. It is attached to the back wall. If you notice problems with your freezer then check to see if there is anything blocking a fan blade. If there is no obstruction, test the evaporator fan motor using a multimeter. Test the 2 wires that travel from the coil on the motor for resistance.

If the Temperature inside the Freezer is too warm, we suggest testing the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat. The best way to do this is to remove the Thermostat from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced. Hope this helps"}

The heat coming for the compressor discharge port, should never be higher than 300°F.  If the temperature is higher than this, then the refrigerant will start to degrade and the compressor will need to be replaced.

I would test your water inlet valve and ice maker for continuity to see if too much water is going to the ice maker. Too much ice buildup can also clog the dispenser flap and make it so that only the crushed ice is getting through and not the bigger cubes. Try taking the bucket out and checking for any obstructions and clearing any trapped ice away. You can test the valve with a multimeter. There are also tests online for your ice maker as well. If you are unfamiliar with how a multimeter functions, there are YouTube videos available to assist you. Hope this helps!"}

If the chute is not closing after the water or ice is dispensed, the issue may be with the actuator or the micro switch.  The actuator is a possible option when ice door won't open or shut properly or when water or is not dispensing. The switch helps control the functions of the dispenser and you may want to test the micro switch with a multimeter to check for electrical continuity, and replace it if it shows no continuity. Also examine the water tank and and the water line connectors for any signs of wear and tear. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"}

If the space between the doors is warmer than normal, there is an issue with air flow over the coils.  You will need to clean the condenser coils. When your condensor coils are clogged up, the heat gets trapped.  This causes your condensor fan to run constantly where it may become damaged or cause it to stop working.  The fan blade may also become damaged.  This extended use can also lead to damage to the fan blade itself like warping or breaks.  If you notice that you no longer hear the fan running, the first thing you will  want to check is that the fan blade is intact and clear of any blockages.  If it seems to be working normally, you’ll need to test that the motor is not damaged, and replace if needed.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"}

If there are food items stuck in or jammed around the ice maker, it may not cycle properly. The ice maker may get stuck in the middle of a cycle or overflow with ice or water. Inspect the icemaker and remove any items that may interfere with its operation. The water inlet valve supplies water to the refrigerator ice and water dispenser. The valve requires a minimum of 20 psi to work properly. If the water pressure is too low, the valve may not close fully when the power is shut off. As a result, the valve leaks water into the ice maker, causing it to overflow. Check the water flow and test the pressure to determine if it is at least 20 psi.

Check the fill tube and fill cup that brings water to the icemaker. It could be clogged with ice. If there is no ice obstructing the tube and cup, test the water inlet valve to be sure both ports on the valve are working. Here is a link on how to test the water valve. https://www.partselect.com/Refrigerator+test-water-valve+repair.htm. You can also try to run the following test on the icemaker itself.Turn icemaker Off for 15 seconds and turn back on,Push in on paddle 3 times and only 3 times within 15 seconds of powering the icemaker back on.Within 3 minutes, the icemaker should enter the harvest mode.The heater will turn on for a about of 20 seconds, and the comb inside the icemaker will make one full revolution and return to the \"Home\" position.At the end of 3 minutes, the icemaker mold should fill with water.The green light under the ON/OFF switch should be on and steady.If this does not fix the issue you may need to replace the icemaker.

Is the puddle of the water normal?"], "Answer": "Hi Jagrit, thank you for your question. You do get draining below your appliance. However if you are getting leaking inside of your appliance it might actually be a temperature issue. When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."}

What parts do. I need"], "Answer": "Hi Angela,\n\nThank you for the question. When the fresh food section is warm you will need to check a few things. You can start by checking for frost build up in the freezer and on the coils on the back of the appliance. If there is frost build up you may need to replace the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat or the Defrost Heater.\n\nIf you do not have a frost build up you need to listen to see if the fan at the back of the freezer is kicking on. The Evaporator Fan circulates air over the refrigerator coils. These coils will convert the heat into cool air, which is then circulated into the fresh food section If the fan is not running then the air will not circulate.\n\nIt is also a good idea to check the gasket around the door. If there are gaps or if it is not sealing properly it will let warm air in. You can turn a flash light on and put it inside the fridge and turn the lights off in the kitchen (evenings are best) and watch for any light coming through around the gasket. \n\nIf everything else checks out you may need to replace the Thermostat. This thermally operated switch, controls the compressor circuit and therefore the temperature of the fresh food compartment.\n\nHope this helps!"}

You cannot use a multi meter unfortunately you would need to have a small piece of insulated wire to test your ice maker. When you remove the ice maker cover that covers the motor, there are two holes at the bottom right hand side of the white wheel on your motor. They are labeled T and H. Place the insulated wire into those two holes and make sure your ice maker is on. If your motor wheel does not start to turn to make ice and bring up your water, then your ice maker is broken and needs to be replaced. Be very careful doing something like this and make sure that you use an insulated wire so that you do not get an electric shock. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."}

We would advised checking the tubing going from the water inlet valve to the icemaker and the and the ice maker water fill tube to see if it is frozen, clogged or cracked. You can also test the ice maker to see if it is functioning properly. To do so, cut a 6- to 8-inch length of 14-gauge solid electrical wire. Use a pair of wire strippers to remove about 1/2 inch of the electrical insulation from each end of the wire. Grab the square cover on the front of your ice maker inside your freezer with your hand. Rock the cover back and forth as you wiggle it away from the front of the ice maker to expose the round gear beneath it. Find two small, round openings marked “H” and “T” beneath the gear. Insert the bare ends of the electrical wire into the openings, so one end of the wire is in one opening and the opposite end is in the other. The wire overrides the timer and manually activates the ice maker. Hope this helps!"}

I ordered a new one from partselect.  While waiting for it to arrive, i noticed that the freezer portion is too cold (-15 to 20 degrees f), and the refrigerator was at 55 degrees.  I found that it was iced up at the bottom of the evaporator not allowing air to flow through the bottom of the freezer, and up into the refrigerator.  (the slide gate is open at the top of the refrigerator allowing cold air to flow in).  I defrosted the unit.  It still is a little warm in the refrigerator ( about 43 degrees versus set point of 37) and the freezer is still -15 to 20 degrees.  I opened up the back panel of the freezer, and check the connections for the defrost thermostat, fan and defrost heater.  All seems normal.  I do not believe the freezer is going through a defrost cycle, but am not sure if just replacing the defrost thermostat will fix the issue of it being continually cold in the freezer.  (it may fix the issue of frost causing low air flow into the refrigerator section causing high temperature in the refrigerator, but will it keep the freezer from getting too cold?  The compressor seems like it is always running when i listen to it.  Maybe a bad temperature sensor for the freezer compartment telling the compressor to stay on continually?  Maybe a circuit board issue?  What do you think?  I hesitate to install the icemaker since there may be other issues.  Time to get rid of this ten year old unit?? thanks.I am a chemical engineer, but may be over my head!"], "Answer": "Hi Rory, Thank you for the question,If you have a Multi Meter I suggest testing the Thermistor. The resistance should read at 77 degrees which is 2.7K ohms of resistance. You can also test the Bi-Metal Defrost Thermostat. Remove it from the refrigerator so you can control the temperature of the sensor. You can let the sensor warm up to room temperature. With the sensor warmed up to room temperature the sensor should read approximately 6.2K Ohms at 68°F. With the thermistor submerged is a glass full of ice water, the sensor should be very close to 32°F which should read approximately 16.3K Ohms. If the values that you are getting are far off from these readings, then the sensor is bad and should be replaced.You can also check for power to the control board and make sure it has the correct amount of volts.

When you are having temperature problems in your fridge, there are a few parts that could cause the issue. You can use a multi meter to test most of the parts. Make sure you cut power to your appliance before doing any repairs or tests. First you should test your defrost thermostat. Place the thermostat in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Another part to check would be your defrost heater. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. You could check your temperature sensor. To find the correct reading for this part you will have to refer to your tech sheet that comes with your appliance. You can usually find this tech sheet behind the bottom grille of your fridge on either the right or left side. These are the most common parts that cause this issue in your appliance. So it is suggested you check them first. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."}

The water inlet valve is located at the back of the refrigerator, and connects to the water supply. The valve can break from material fatigue or normal use. If your water inlet valve is malfunctioning, you could be getting a lack of water to the inside of your refrigerator. Your ice maker may not produce cubes or your water dispenser may not work. The water inlet valve must be replaced if the solenoids no longer have continuity or the valve has internal blockage. This valve measures approximately 7 inches long and 4.5 inches wide, and is constructed of plastic and metal. It comes in blue, and includes the valve and mounting bracket."}

To get size specifications like that you would have to contact the manufacturer. Unfortunately they do not give us that information. However it sounds like your doors may not be level and that is why you are getting a gap. I would suggest first checking to see if your fridge itself is level. If it is, then you will have to take a look at your hinges and your bushings. It is likely that they are either broken, worn out, or unlevel. Good luck with your repair."}

I would suggest testing your water inlet valve. The valve has two solenoids, one for your water inlet valve and one for your ice maker. It could be that the solenoid for your ice maker might be malfunctioning. You can test your part with a multi-meter. This test is fairly simple, all you have to do is set you multi-meter to the lowest setting. The calibrate it until the needle is on zero. You will then take each prob to the terminals inside of the plugs for each of your water inlet valve's solenoids. If the solenoid is reading 500 - 1500 ohms, then your valve is fine. However if your reading is close to or stays on zero, you will have to replace your valve. Also check your fill tube as well, it could be that there is an ice build up in the tube and it is blocking water from getting to your ice maker. I hope this helps you. Good luck with your repair."}

The ice maker works, it makes ice, the bail works but i am getting a block of ice forming in the ice pan every few days. I looked under the ice mold when water was running in from fill cup and it appears that water is leaking along the front edge of the mold and  i suspect the ice maker needs to be replaced (it's 13 years old.) also, i am finding a glaze of ice on the floor of the freezer and, occasionally (once or twice a week), a small puddle of water on the floor under the fridge. It appears to me that water is working its way down through the freezer from the ice maker because i' have found ice on top of food items on the shelves as well. The ice maker looks like it would be easy to replace based on internet research and your website. I am wondering about the occasional puddle of water on the floor and whether the water inlet valve should also be replaced or if the water from inside the freezer is working it's way to the outside. Based on your opinion I'll order parts to replace the ice maker. Thanks."], "Answer": "Hi Rick, Thank you for the question. When the ice maker is leaking it can cause the puddle you are getting. I suggest replacing the ice maker first as it will need to be replaced to fix the block of ice in the ice cube pan and see if that fixes the issue. You can also remove the backing from the appliance and take a rag, wrap it around the valve and check it after 24 hours to see if it is wet. Hope this helps!"}

I took it out ,its not cracked and sometimes it stopped leaking for a bit then started leaking again."], "Answer": "Hi Vincent,\n\nThank you for your question. I would suggest figuring out where your leaking is coming from first. If it is coming from below the ice maker tray, then it is likely you will need to replace your ice maker. However if the leaking is happening because the tray is being over filled with water, you should test your water inlet valve with a multi meter to see if it is working correctly. It could be that the solenoid for your ice maker has failed. If your valve is fine, you will  need to replace your ice maker. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."}

The white flakes that are appearing in your ice are caused by calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate which are found in hard water.  Calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate are harmless, but if you want perfect, flake-free ice cubes, you will need to soften your water.  I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"}

Its a very easy repair, and takes little time. It can take 24 hours for the new ice maker to start making ice, so be patient if it doesn't make ice right away! I hope this helps!"}

Where is this water coming from and freezing under the bottom drawer, and what are the possible repairs?"], "Answer": "Hi Albert, \n\nThank you for your question. There could be a number of things that are leaking in your appliance. I would suggest taking a look at your ice maker first, just make sure there are no breaks or the part is not over filling with water and causing the leak. You may also want to look at the fill tube/cup that pours the water into the ice maker mold. Another thing that you could check is your defrost thermostat and heater. It might be that your freezer section is defrosting a bit too much and the water is just pooling at the bottom there. You may also want to check the drain in your freezer, make sure that it is not iced over and blocking the water from draining out of the freezer during the defrost cycle. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."}

If your freezer is not maintaining a temperature between 0 and 5-degrees Fahrenheit (-18 to -15C) it will not make ice. There are a few things that could cause your refrigerator to run all the time and cause temperature issues. To test your defrost thermostat, place it in ice cold water for 2-3 minutes after removing it from your appliance. It should be reading 0 ohms to be working correctly. Part number: PS469522. Check your defrost heater, part number: PS2581596. Remove it from the appliance. It should be reading anywhere between 0 - 50 ohms to be working. Check your evaporator fan motor. Make sure it is not clogged with ice and that the shaft turns freely. You can also test with a multimeter. Touch one of the tester leads to one terminal and the other lead to the other terminal. If you get a very high or infinite resistance reading (which is denoted by OL on a digital meter), there's a break somewhere, meaning the coil is bad and the fan needs to be replaced. Part number PS12729077. Check your freezer door gasket to make sure it is sealing properly. Part number PS1991325. If all these parts are good, we would suggest replacing the condenser fan.

It stops when the door is open. But will continuously fill with water anytime the door is closed. What could the problem be?"], "Answer": "Hello Lyman, thank you for your question. The first part you will want to check in this kind of situation is the water fill valve. It sounds like the water valve is stuck in an open position. Checking a water valve is very easy. Use your multitester to test the valve for continuity. Set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each of the meter's probes to a terminal. If you receive a reading of infinity, it means the valve's solenoid is faulty and the valve needs to be replaced. If your valve has two solenoids (four terminals), test the second pair of terminals in the same manner. If either pair of terminals receives a result of infinity, replace the water inlet valve. You do not have to remove the water inlet valve from the dishwasher in order to test it. Just make sure power is not getting to your dishwasher before you conduct the test. If the valve is not faulty, the issue is most likely the control board, as that board is what runs the cycles on the unit and acts like a timer, it could be stuck in a fill setting The water valve for your appliance is part number 154637401 and the board is part number 154886103.

If the upper spray arm is not turning, then it is likely clogged with debris and it will need to be cleaned.  To clean the spray arm, remove it from the dishwasher and place it in a solution of dishsoap, 1 cup of vinegar and warm water and let it soak until the debris has loosened.  If there are mineral deposits from hard water, soak it in vinegar. Use an old toothbrush, or other scrubbers to clean the surfaces of the arm.

They are not like the ones that are on it now    thanks"], "Answer": "Hi David, \n\nThank you for your question. First you will have to remove your upper dish rack and the old adjust kit. Now, when installing the new kit, count 4 rungs from the back of the basket toward the front. Take your  new metal adjuster and thread the shaft through the fourth rung. You may have to tilt it to get it through. When you straighten the part the wheels portion should be on the outside of the rack and the shaft will  be on the inside of the rack. Take your positioner clips and use them to secure the adjuster to the rack. You will see two front tabs and two back tabs. The back tabs will also need to be tilted into place so that they are on the inside of the rack. The flat part of the positioner clips should be on the outside of the rack. Then you will push the clips down on to the adjuster to clip them into place. Now you will have to install the adjuster body on to the adjuster. Pull your adjuster all the way down. Tilt the adjusted toward the inside of the rack, you will notice that the adjuster body has a channel that will fit the adjuster. Slide those two pieces into place together. You will have 4 notches on your adjuster body that fit perfectly with your rack. Pull on your metal adjuster to lock it into place. Grab your actuator. You want to make sure that the thumb pad of your actuator is facing toward the inside of the rack and is closer to the front of the rack. Pull the adjuster arm up as far as you can, so that the body is a little bit above the top of the rack. The set the actuator inside of the two slots at the top of the body. You may have to tilt the body toward the inside of the rack to fit the actuator into place. Once you have that part in place, push the whole assembly down and press it back up against the side of the rack into place again. Now you will take the adjuster cover and install it on to the body from the outside of the rack. There is a little tab at the top of the cover, you will have to push that into place in the slot at the top of the adjuster body. That just snaps down into place. Then you install your two T15 Torx screws into the cover to hold it into place. This installation is the same for both sides. I hope that helps. Good luck with your repair."}

According to our research, if the amount of water left in the dishwasher after a cycle is no more than two cups, then this is normal. Usually, the appliance remains wet after a cycle due to the condensation drying principle which creates water droplets in the tub. The moisture in the air condenses on the inside walls, runs off, and is pumped out. A thorough cleaning of the filter and hoses with vinegar and detergent might help prevent this issue. We hope this information helps!"}

Yes, if the water is more than 2 cups and it is overflowing, it is recommended to check the float switch, part number PS11750031.

To pull the dishwasher out from under the countertop. Shut off the electricity at the breaker. Tip: place a piece of tape over the breaker switch to ensure no one turns it on while you're working. Turn off the water under the sink. Take off the front cover at the bottom of the dishwasher to expose the wiring. Use a voltage meter to test the wires at the dishwasher to ensure the power is still off. Remove the electrical box from the unit. Unscrew the wire nuts and pull apart the wires. Start with the green wires, white and then black. Disconnect the drain line from the dishwasher and the water supply line from the dedicated dishwasher stop. Open the door to the dishwasher, then remove the screws secured to the underside of the countertop. Raise the legs using a wrench. Slowly pull out the dishwasher ensuring the wires are out of the way. Also, the drain line should come out with the dishwasher from under the sink. Tip: Place a drop cloth or piece of cardboard in front of the dishwasher to prevent scratches on the floor. Also, before turning electricity back on, make sure to tape or cap off the ends of the three exposed wires.

This part is attached to the bottom of your dishwasher inner door panel. It is frequently exposed to water and detergent during its lifetime. The water and chemicals can eventually wear down the gasket and compromise the integrity of the seal. If the gasket is malfunctioning, the integrity of the door seal will be effected. You will notice leaking through the bottom of your dishwasher door. If your dishwasher is leaking water from the bottom of the door, first inspect the seal for food particles near the bottom and sides, and remove the buildup, as it can stop the door from closing properly and keeping a tight seal; if not, you may need to replace the bottom door gasket. Check the door gasket for tears, cuts, or wear. This part is sold individually and measures 22.5 inches by 1.25 inches. It is constructed of plastic, and comes in yellow/grey.

To remove the dishwasher from the cabinet, first unplug the appliance from the electrical outlet.  Also shut off the water supply valve.  Then remove the screws securing the lower access panel and set the panel aside.   Disconnect the water supply line from the inlet valve and be prepared for some water to spill out.  Remove the the screw securing the junction box cover.  Note the orientation of the wires on the terminal block and loosen the screws to release the wires.  Remove the screws securing the bracket.  Use a flat head screw driver to release the nut from the bracket, then disconnect the drain hose and feed it through the cabinet.  Once you have completed these steps, open the dishwasher door and release the mounting screws securing dishwasher to the cabinet. To remove the dishwasher, you may need to remove the levelling legs locking screws.  Once removed, you can pull the dishwasher from the cabinet.  We hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day."}

I normally run it at auto cycle, heating, and it takes between 2 3 hrs to complete. Of late I have been noticing water droplet condensation towards upper left under kitchen counter top (above the door of the dish washer) during the cycle.These water droplets fall down and form a pool that is spoiling the hard wood flooring of the kitchen close to the kitchen cabinet adjacent to the dish washer. This dishwasher has no vents on the door top that could facilitate heat condensation to dissipate. I assume this could be a gasket problem, but there are two gaskets in the dishwasher,inner and outer one. The inner one probably seals the inner part (extended portion towards washer) of the door and the outer one probably seals the little outer part of the door. Please let me know if the above could be a possible reason.  This dishwasher is from previous home owners who retained it for us. It also displays 10 years limited parts warranty on the door. Looking forward to your help, thanks."], "Answer": "Hi Kaiser, Thank you for the question. As far as the warranty goes you will need to contact Maytag. It will be best to inspect the gaskets to check for any wear or damage. The most likely cause is the gasket that attaches tot he door, PartSelect Number PS11722167. I also suggest checking to make sure the door is latched properly. If the latch is not holding the door closed it can cause the leak as well.Hope this helps!"}

Do you have a video on how to remove the basket from the track and also how to replace the track to see if i can do the repairs myself or not?"], "Answer": "Hello Doug and thanks for writing.\nWe do not have a video but here are step by step instructions.\nUse a 1/4\" nut driver to remove the bottom front (kick) plate from the appliance. There are two screws, one at each end. There should also be two screws fastening the dishwasher to the countertop. You'll need to open the dishwasher door to see these and remove them. At the bottom of the dishwasher again, you might need to screw the front (2) leveling feet in to lower the dishwasher and provide clearance. Once done, just (gently, slowly) pull the appliance out of the cabinet. Check to make sure your power wiring, drain hose, and water supply hose are all long enough to do this. If necessary, disconnect any of these that are too short. if your power wiring is short, as mine was, you'll need to disconnect the circuit breaker, then remove the junction box at the lower front right side of the dishwasher, then disconnect the power and ground wires.\nOnce out of the cabinet, use a 5/16\" nut driver to remove the four screws holding each rack slide in place and remove the track. The rubber mounts will come out with the track (new tracks include new rubber mounts). Clean any residue from the track mounting area inside the tub before installing the new track. This whole replacement process should take a total of 3-4 minutes per side.\nTo finish up, just reverse the process. When sliding the dishwasher back into place, make sure the fiberglass insulation stays in place completely around the outside of the tub. We hope this helps. Please contact us anytime."}

The bE error code is triggered by improper detergent use or a dishwasher that is not level. Using the wrong detergent leads to excess sudsing, causing parts like the vent to become filled with soap foam. A dishwasher that is not level will do the same, causing water to flow to parts where it does not belong, potentially damaging components. To fix the issue adjust leveling feet as necessary. To remove detergent residue in the tub pour approximately three to seven ounces of milk into a shallow bowl and place it in the upper rack and run the dishwasher on the Auto cycle.

Part ps11756150"], "Answer": "Hi Val,\nThank you for your inquiry.  Before beginning any repair please unplug the dishwasher and wear gloves to protect your hands. Release the track stops from the upper dishrack rails and pull the upper rack from the dishwasher and place it upside down on a work surface.  Raise the wheels to the maximum height.  Release the top of the long rear clip from the dishrack tine and push the clip down to the release point and remove it.  Press the tab down on the front clip move the clip up to pull it off. Release the locking tabs  on the clip in the middle of the height adjuster and remove the clip. Using a slot screw driver pry the housing cover down and out to release the upper tabs on each side.  Pry the bottom of the housing cover out of the 2 lower locking tabs.  Pull the housing cover off the rack.  Remove the adjuster housing and wheel assembly and repeat the procedure on the other side.  Slide the vertical portion on the new wheel assembly between the fourth set of vertical tines from the back of the dishrack and rotate the wheel assembly so that it lays flat against the side.  Insert a positioner clip above the rear wheel and snap the tab into the slot.  Install a positioner clip on the front wheel.  Position the adjuster body over the vertical portion of the wheel assembly and push in into the slots. Locking tabs at the bottom of the adjuster body engage the the wheel assembly once it is fully inserted the tabs.  Insert the actuator lever into the adjuster body with the thumb pad facing the front of the rack.  Two half circle cut outs on the adjuster body hold the actuator in place.  Push the adjuster body down and install the adjuster cover.  Install the adjuster cover mounting screws.  Repeat this process on the other side of the rack.  Push the upper dishrack onto its tracks.  Close the track stops on the rails and the repair is done. I hope this helps.  Thank you and have a great day!"}

At this time, we do not have a video for this exact part number but I have found instructions for you. Use a small flat head screwdriver to depress the retaining tabs securing the rack adjustors to the tracks. Fully remove the upper rack. Using the flat blade screwdriver, release the tabs to detach the adjuster housing cover and remove the housing. Next detach the front and rear adjuster support straps from the tines and remove them from the rack adjuster. Note the orientation of the rack adjuster, then pry off the stop clip to detach the old adjuster. Install the new adjuster by aligning it on the rack and snap the stop clip into place to secure. Next replace the front and rear support straps. Position the adjuster housing by aligning the locking lever in the adjuster slot then snap the cover on to secure.

Before performing this test, unplug the dishwasher from the electrical outlet and turn the water off.  With a multimeter, set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each of the meter's probes to a terminal. If you receive a reading of infinity, it means the valve's solenoid is faulty and the valve needs to be replaced. If your valve has two solenoids (four terminals), test the second pair of terminals in the same manner. If either pair of terminals receives a result of infinity, replace the water inlet valve.

I do not seem to have good cleaning pressure. I have cleaned all the filters and spray arms and changed the water inlet valve."], "Answer": "Hi Brad, Thank you for the question. The drain hose may not have a loop in it. The fill water may be draining out of the dishwasher by going straight out the drain hose. Be sure that your drain hose is not simply laying straight. It must have a loop in it or be off the ground so the water is not gravity fed out via the drain hose. You can also try to empty the dishwasher, set it to run a wash cycle. Let it fill with water as normal. When the dishwasher begins the cycle, open the door and see if the water level is just under the heating elements.If there is not enough water there may be a clog in your water fill line. Remove the fill hose where it attaches to the fill valve. Check to be sure there is nothing clogging the screen on the inlet fill valve. Also check the water fill line for blockage. You can also check the Overfill Control Switch if it is not filling with water at the correct level. If it is defective it can shut the water flow off too soon. Hope this helps!"}

To test the element, locate your dishwasher's heating element. Open the dishwasher door and look into the tub. It is the thin, circular tube at the base of your dishwasher. It may or may not be covered. If it is covered, remove the lower dishrack, and then remove the cover.\n\nYour heating element is going to have two metal terminals. One at each end. Each terminal reaches downwards, into the base of the dishwasher. Mentally mark the area where each terminal enters the base of the tub.\n\nNow you need to gain access to the heating element's wiring. You can do this by first removing the lower kickplate panel of the dishwasher. There will be at least two screws (but maybe four) holding the kickplate panel in place. They are located either on the top or the bottom of the panel. If the screws are located on the top, you may need to open the dishwasher door in order to gain access to them. Close the door to remove the panel, though.\n\nNow look into the lower access area that you have just uncovered. Pinpoint the area where the heating element terminals extend through the base of the dishwasher. They will each have a wire connected to it. Label each of the wires so that you will be able to properly reconnect them later. Now you can pull the wires off the terminals.\n\nEach wire is connected to a terminal using a slip-on connector. Grasp the connector and pull on it firmly. DO NOT pull on the wire itself. Pull only from the connector. You may decide you need to use a pair of needle nosed pliers to help you.\n\nUse your multitester (aka multimeter) to test the heating element for continuity. Set the device to the ohms setting x 1. Touch each meter probe to a terminal. You should receive a reading somewhere in between infinity and zero. Because of the variety of makes and models of dishwashers, it is quite difficult to say exactly what the reading should be for each and every possible model. However, if the test you conduct produces a reading of infinite resistance (meter's needle does not move), then that is indicative of a faulty heating element, and you should replace yours. Similarily, if the test you conduct produces a reading of zero resistance (meter's needle moves to the other extreme of the scale), then that is also indicative of a faulty heating element, and you should replace yours.\n\nYou do not have to remove the heating element from the dishwasher in order to test it. Just make sure power is not getting to your dishwasher before you conduct the test. I hope this helps!"}

If you notice your dishwasher is not draining or has a lot of water buildup at the bottom of the sump assembly, this filter may be damaged, clogged or broken, and in need of a replacement. To replace this pump assembly, you will only need a Philips-head screwdriver, but should start by removing your dishwasher racks. Then, pull up on the lower spray arm, and drain trap to remove them. Next, rotate the spray arm support and pull that up to remove it, at which point you can remove the base and filter for the drain pump. With those out, you can use your Philips-head screwdriver to disconnect and remove the cover and drain pump assembly. With the pump removed, you can inspect it or install the new drain pump assembly, with the same hardware as before.

What else could be my problem? Appreciate any help."], "Answer": "Hi Larry, \nThank you for your inquiry.  There a couple of reasons why your detergent dispenser may not be dispensing correctly.  The rinse aid cap may be lose and just needs to be tightened or it may be warped if it was damaged from the heat of the water in the dishwasher.  You will need to remove the cap to inspect it.  Also, the spring and hinge pin on the dispenser door could be the problem. The dispenser door is spring loaded, and is held in the closed position by a catch. Check that the spring and pin are not bent or broken and replace if required. If the catch is not releasing the door, then you should inspect the timer, the bi-metal release or the wax motor. I hope this helps with your repair.  Thank you and have a great day!"}
